To use multiple paragraphs separate them by two newlines

```markdown
First paragraph

Second paragraph
```

If you are using [GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/) or [Markdown Here](https://markdown-here.com/) just add a newline for a line-break like so

```markdown
First line of paragraph.
Second line of paragraph.
```
        
However, if you are using original [Markdown Spec](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) then add two spaces at the end of the line to add a line-break

```markdown
First line of paragraph.  
Second line of paragraph.
```
