To use multiple paragraphs separate them by two newlines

```markdown
First paragraph

Second paragraph
```

To use a line break:
- if you are using [GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec](https://github.github.com/gfm/) or [Markdown Here](https://markdown-here.com/) just add a newline like so

        ```markdown
        First line of paragraph.
        Second line of paragraph.
        ```
        
- if you are using original [Markdown Spec](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) then add two spaces at the end of the line

        ```markdown
        First line of paragraph.  
        Second line of paragraph.
        ```
