For ordered lists use numbers (actual numbers don't matter ie. you can use just the 1's if you want to) followed by a dot

```markdown
1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
3. And another item
```

For unordered lists use asterisks, minuses or pluses

```markdown
* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
```

To make lists within lists just indent it with at least 4 spaces or a tab

```markdown
1. First ordered list item
    * Unordered sub-list item
    * Another sub-list item
2. Second ordered list item
```

To put paragraph within a list item indent by at least 4 spaces or a tab, make the blank line above and below it

```markdown
1. Some list-item

    This is my paragraph within a list-item.

2. Another list-item
```
